# **Professional Self-Assessment**
  After transferring to SNHU, I started the computer science program and gained momentum by using real devices to practice real skills which has influenced the way I view my strengths and professional goals. I first concentrated on the basics before focusing on mobile development after creating an Android app and then rewriting it in Kotlin. I learned how to clearly explain results and relate decisions to what employers value by keeping a record of my plans and progress. By thinking back on my development, I was able to transition from a broad interest in software to a specific path in Android development with specific next steps, such as certification and further education.
  I was able to establish a consistent approach to software engineering through the coursework throughout the program. I gained the ability to modernize code without affecting user behavior and to separate concerns between the platform services, persistence layer, and user interface. My habits regarding null safety, succinct data representations, and readable logic were reinforced when I switched to Kotlin. I also worked on writing design notes that clearly explain tradeoffs and provide justifications for changes. These practices facilitate teamwork, lower maintenance costs, and demonstrate my ability to maintain a codebase's stability as it evolves.
  By selecting data structures that align with actual product constraints, I improved my algorithmic and data structure judgment. By constructing a scheduler based on a priority queue, I developed the ability to reason about correctness initially followed by considerations of scale. Also, I learned how to prepare the next scheduled item in advance, how to efficiently rebuild from storage, and how to manage edge cases such as event edits occurring close to a trigger time. This experience solidified the concept that decisions for algorithms should help create more predictable and understandable behavior as the application grows.
  My work with databases has improved my understanding of how models enable features. Also, this database work allowed me to gain the skills required to create migrations that protect existing data, index fields that enable common queries, and store times as precise epoch values instead of as strings. When schema validation required the recreation of a table, I made the necessary modifications to ensure the structure stuck to the persistence library's specifications and I confirmed the outcomes through simple tests. With those competencies, I'm now able to securely develop a schema and preserve the application's responsiveness as the volume of data grows.
  Instead of being something I add at the end, security has become a part of my routine. I was able to minimize exposure by using permission checks, replacing plain text credentials with salted hashes, keeping sensitive data out of logs, and keeping broadcast components inside the app. By verifying that behavior remained constant while the surface area for errors decreased, I was able to link these choices to user impact. I plan to approach a team with a mindset that treats security and meticulous logging as a standard engineering practice.
  Collaboration and communication improved as I engaged in quicker feedback cycles. I equipped myself for code reviews by utilizing targeted checklists, brief sessions, and author notes to provide reviewers with context. I structured recorded walkthroughs based on explicit criteria, enabling a teammate to understand the rationale and observe the impact of modifications. Also, I improved my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders by summarizing objectives, explaining limitations, and demonstrating how the work aligns with user and business requirements. I was able to present results in an easily evaluable manner by writing with hiring managers in mind.
  My approach to assessing opportunities has been influenced by researching trends. I focused on the ways that learning loops link data, assessment, and human feedback, as well as the ongoing blending of mobile experiences with spatial interfaces. My interest in scheduling, notifications, and multimedia on everyday devices is consistent with that viewpoint. Additionally, it emphasizes how crucial observability, boundaries, and gradual development are to the applications I create.
  Together, the artifacts tell a cohesive story of enhancing the same application from several angles. The software engineering work demonstrates my ability to update a codebase while maintaining consistency in behavior and enhancing safety and clarity. The algorithm's performance demonstrates my ability to select a structure that ensures the timing logic is scalable and predictable. My ability to develop a schema, write a migration that protects user data, and index for performance is demonstrated by my database work. Each artifact focuses on one dimension of the same product and they reinforce one another. The result is code that is clearer to read, more efficient to schedule, and more reliable to store and query. Together they demonstrate the range of skills that matter on a mobile team.
  By completing the program, I learned how to tackle new problems in a repeatable manner. I start with a solid strategy that enhances the system by making the smallest change required to implement the enhancement, use focused tests to confirm the new behavior, and document my findings so that others can build upon them. That template has influenced my values and aspirations as a developer. I want to help create mobile applications that place value on trustworthy, straightforward user experiences by combining careful design, intelligent algorithms, reliable data models, and a security mindset.
